                * WALKTHROUGH WITH CODE SNIPPETS (this will have a companion repo on GitHub)  (8 minutes, 25 total)
                    * Set up your test environment:
                        * `before` - start your local server, make sure your directories to store screenshots exists
                        * `after` - stop your server
                        * `afterEach` - reload your Puppeteer browser
                    * Set up a test:
                        * Load the Puppeteer browser
                        * Set your viewport size, or emulate a specific device
                        * Take the screenshot
                        * Compare your screenshot with the expected view
                    * Example (I would include this as a demo, but this is cool to see the output that you get when your site changes):
                        * Original screenshot of DinosaurJS site: ![original screenshot of DinosaurJS site](https://s3.amazonaws.com/dinojs/dinosaurjs.org_original.png)
                            * Screenshot of DinosaurJS site with elements moved: ![screenshot of DinosaurJS site with elements moved](https://s3.amazonaws.com/dinojs/dinosaurjs.org_changed.png)
                            * Image showing diff between screenshots: ![image showing diff between screenshots](https://s3.amazonaws.com/dinojs/dinosaurjs.org_diff.png)
